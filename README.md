# âš¡ Power System Load Type Classification
ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this project is to build an effective machine learning model to classify power system load into three categories:
1. Light_Load
2. Medium_Load
3. Maximum_Load
Using historical data including electrical usage and power factor measurements, the objective is to create a robust, explainable model capable of making accurate predictions.
